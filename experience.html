        <h2>HBS Conecta</h2>
        <p>When I was promoting my services as a  <em>Designer</em> I had the great opportunity to work as <em>freelancer</em> for a telecom company called <strong>HBS Conecta</strong>, this design
          was used for marketing in their website, I worked on their website designs most part of the process and I also had the chance to code a little bit.</p>

      <h2>Maquipucuna</h2>
      <p>Part of my Multimedia Design studies have given me the opportunity to work with an Ecological Reserve called <strong>Maquipucuna</strong> which is located a mere two hours from Ecuador's
      capital, Quito. I worked developing some wireframes for the redesign of their new website. This was an internship experience that was pretty awesome.</p>
      <p>Here is a a video in detail to showcase the process that I went through to come up with a final design, although it's in Spanish I'll promise I'll add subtitles in the future.</p>
      <!-- This part of code was used from YouTube embed video, just wanted to add an extra bit to make it look better -->
      <iframe class="center-image" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6A6o0xH5dk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
